# The Ongoing List of Game Ideas

This list started with [this video] in which I try to come up with a new game idea every minute. The goal isn't to create fully fleshed out plans for new games, but rather stumble across a few pretty interesting ideas in a relatively short amount of time. I decided to take most of the ideas that I came up with and make them freely available. Usually I'll add a few more of my thoughts to that idea before putting it in this list.

Feel free to use any of the ideas listed in this repository to make games of your own. If you do make something, please let me know because I would love to play it and add it to some kind of showcase in this repository. I hope people enjoy this little ongoing project and I look forward to seeing what you make!

## Randomized House
A player moves through a simple house looking for a list of items, similar to a scavenger hunt. The house's simplicity allows its state to be randomized (which doors are open, where movable items are placed, which rooms have their lights on). The player is racing against a timer to find the list of items but must also leave the house in its original state upon leaving.

## Moving Tower Defense
The Player is on a moving platform, like a raft, and must gather materials from the water like wood and metal to expand the raft, create buffers and add more room for defense. The raft is what is being defended against the enemy towers.

## Multiplayer Traveling Building
Multiple players work together on a multilevel building to deconstruct the building and literally move it forward. The idea would be to maintain proper balance and structure so that the building does not fall. It might be difficult not to make the gameplay super repetitive, but maybe the building must traverse over obstacles that make preserving resources difficult.

## Co-op Challenge Game
Each player will take turns moving through a simple platform level. The first player is essentially the "RUNNER" and the other player is the "GUNNER", or something along those lines. As the first player moves through the level, it's up to the second player to remember the path and especially the timing of the first, because when they go through, they will lay traps and attacks that will activate at specific times. Once both players have gone, their movements will play out together and see if the first player survived.

The order could be reversed as well and let the "GUNNER" lay down traps first and see if the other player can remember and properly traverse the level.

## Dungeon Optimization
Given a randomized stack of dungeon "tiles", build out a simple dungeon based on certain optimization rules. Examples of some possibilities of maximizing score:
 * Having a chest in a room with at least two traps
 * Having at least one deadend path
 * Make your dungeon perfectly symmetrical

## Active Farming Incremental
Grid-like farm, the crops are almost always growing but at first you don't know when to harvest. Learn through experimentation and observation to harvest at the right times. Eventually gain items that will give you more information about individual crops, weather, and timing. Possibily include additional tooling upgrades as you make the grid of crops larger and large (Start with 2x2 and eventually work up to 32x32?)

## Ridiculous Lock Incremental
Imagine a simple combination lock, the idea is that a random combination appears each time the player hits "ATTEMPT" or "UNLOCK", and each click essentially raises the chance of unlocking the lock. At first the game is almost impossible, but eventually the player will "UNLOCK" items that will make unlocking each lock easier. This is a weaker idea, but I think there might be something there.

## Switching Characters Platformer
The characters have differing abilities, but the primary use case is that when you switch from character to the other, the previous character freezes for several seconds and can be used as a block. Maybe with three characters you could create some kind of impossible challenge in which they must ascend a vertical shaft using only the freeze and switch ability.

## Two Isometric Planes Colony
Simply two isometric maps, one above the other, where the top plane is focused on agriculture while the bottom is focused on mining. Each level would need to share specific resources with the other (Food from the top into the mines and ore from the mines to the surface for tools?)

## Planet System Builder
You start as a single rotating planet and use various methods to "hook" or attach other planets to you. You can pull them in or simply connect. The original idea was to build a tower and time it properly to connect another planet, but there might be potential for something more complex like combining different rocket abilities to tether the planets. Not exactly sure what the goal would be or what failure would look like.

## The Life of a Desk Worker
You're managing the desk of an office worker and repeating the same mundane tasks. A note (or email) comes your way asking you to do something morally questionable. It could be something like purposefully messing up one of the files you're working with. This idea may be a little too close to Papers, Please, but it could be something interesting.

## Sword Platformer
Simple platformer full of enemies but you cannot attack, you can only counter and redirect other enemies attacks. 

## Enemy Designer
12="Build out behavior of your enemies so that your player kills them (watch how the player acts and place the enemies in the right position\"
"

13="Fast paced 2D top down fencing, hallway, not much room to dodge, the only way is forward (macho swashbuckling adventure, cut throug enemies)"

14="Platformer where you're invincible if you don't move"

15="Colony tetris, the tetriminos are buildings, optimization of different room placement"

16="Document with arbitrary symbols and color combinations, limited amount of time and short description of how the colors (mini platformer at the top) affect the runner/ player"

17="Only one drop of fuel... Maybe a rocket out of control falling (optimize power inside to maximize fueld for suicide burn"

18="Floating blocks platformer, make it super easy, if the player fell into the water they would discover secret world"

19="Mobile brick laying, side to side movement, drop a brick and have the integrity of the wall tested at the end o fthe level"

20="Form a 3D shape, you're given a flat mishapen polygon and you have to draw the fold lines to form the shape??"

21="Infinite Ladder"

22="Minimalist Ship Adventure (behavior differs amongst ships in the fleet) Much more of a conversation / decision travel game"

23="Create fake mobile applications based on weird requirements for companies and sell them (slight random chance related to success)"

24="2D Maze Game, Online Co-op, both players can only SEE the other player's view (they're seperated) and they have to communicate) "

25="2D Prop Hunt (the players can ask questions from a list) and other players must answer honestly "
