# The Ongoing List of Game Ideas

This list started with [this video] in which I try to come up with a new game idea every minute. The goal isn't to create fully fleshed out plans for new games, but rather stumble across a few pretty interesting ideas in a relatively short amount of time. I decided to take most of the ideas that I came up with and make them freely available. Usually I'll add a few more of my thoughts to that idea before putting it in this list.

Feel free to use any of the ideas listed in this repository to make games of your own. If you do make something, please let me know because I would love to play it and add it to some kind of showcase in this repository. I hope people enjoy this little ongoing project and I look forward to seeing what you make!

0="Inspired by Gone Home, so a player moves through a house looking for a list of items, their success is determined by how closely the house resembles it's original state when leaving, randomized house, (open drawers, missing items)"
1="Player is on a moving platform (like a raft), gather materials from water like wood to expand the raft, create buffers and add more room for defense?"
2="Moving building, plaayers on different floors dismantling construction and moving building away from flood or lava or something"
3="Two player challenge game first player goes, then second. The path of the first player should be remembered and the second player lays traps (swords falling) and the player would need to remember the timing"
4="Dungeon Optimization (build out dungeons based on random 'decks' of dungeon tiles, AI moves through your dungon maybe?"
5="Timing Farming Incremental, maybe watch the crops and you have to time the perfect harvest based on limited informataion, over time use your profits to buy better equipment "
6="Lock Incremental Game, your clicks simply raise your luck or chance of success, you're trying to get it as high as possible"
7="Two characters, the player must switch between them. They're both needed to complete the level, so varying abilities, even one ability - when you switch, the previous block becomes stationary and you can jump on them"
8="Isometric Survival Minimalist Colony - Two planes, the top plane is agriculture and the bottom is mining / underground "
9="2D planet generator, You're building cities to other planets, expand your planet by literally constructing a tower precisely into another planet (grab the planet, connect your orbits)"
10="Managing the desk of an office worker, maybe a 2D Stanley Parable, you're given tasks by email from your boss and it's up the player to fulfill them, morally que"
11="Simple quick reaction based platformer swordfighting game, you can't aattack, you can only counter"
12="Build out behavior of your enemies so that your player kills them (watch how the player acts and place the enemies in the right position\"
"
13="Fast paced 2D top down fencing, hallway, not much room to dodge, the only way is forward (macho swashbuckling adventure, cut throug enemies)"
14="Platformer where you're invincible if you don't move"
15="Colony tetris, the tetriminos are buildings, optimization of different room placement"
16="Document with arbitrary symbols and color combinations, limited amount of time and short description of how the colors (mini platformer at the top) affect the runner/ player"
17="Only one drop of fuel... Maybe a rocket out of control falling (optimize power inside to maximize fueld for suicide burn"
18="Floating blocks platformer, make it super easy, if the player fell into the water they would discover secret world"
19="Mobile brick laying, side to side movement, drop a brick and have the integrity of the wall tested at the end o fthe level"
20="Form a 3D shape, you're given a flat mishapen polygon and you have to draw the fold lines to form the shape??"
21="Infinite Ladder"
22="Minimalist Ship Adventure (behavior differs amongst ships in the fleet) Much more of a conversation / decision travel game"
23="Create fake mobile applications based on weird requirements for companies and sell them (slight random chance related to success)"
24="2D Maze Game, Online Co-op, both players can only SEE the other player's view (they're seperated) and they have to communicate) "
25="2D Prop Hunt (the players can ask questions from a list) and other players must answer honestly "
